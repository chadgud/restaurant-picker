# Hello!
Thanks for taking the time to look at my project, Dinner Decider! You can try it out for yourself [here](https://dinnerdecider.chadgud.dev).

My wife and I often have a hard time deciding on a place to eat when we go out. This app is meant to solve that problem. 

Let me take you on a quick tour!

## Landing Page

The start page provides directions and asks the user for their location (browswer location services must be turned on for this to work).
